    <h1>How I became a Softwear Engineer</h1>

I was 18 when I began working in music. I am now 36. It is crazy to think that I have been working in music for 1/2 of my life. And I do think I have accomplished a lot! I have a master’s degree… I have built a music rights/license business… I have sync’d w Netflix, Showtime, CW… The music I own the rights to has accrued +1M streams for something like the last 4 years in a row… I have played festivals, Carnegie hall, sold out tours, and I have even been to Europe to perform. But* when I was about 34 and still didn’t have enough money/credit/tax history to buy a home, I began to get frustrated with my situation. Basically… despite me accomplishing so many of my dreams, I felt like society as a whole wasn’t really interested in those kinds of accomplishments.  I was going to make things easier for myself (get financing for a home/be a normal person), then I needed to find ways to align myself with what the tax man said was important. So, I started asking harder questions. <p>

    One of the first questions I wrestled with, “Do I have what it takes to be successful?”. I was proud of what I had accomplished in music but who is to say I didn’t get lucky. I know I worked hard… but even a broken clock is right twice a day. As I looked around and my peers outside of music were getting their second home and stacking +$100K into their 401K, I didn’t think it was because they were outworking me. In fact, as I looked around at the people in the world, the general census I got was that most people don’t work near as hard as me. In fact, from my perspective, it might read that most people are pretty lazy. So, I sought to find a commonality I could compare my works to the works of others. <P>
    
    What is competitive, unbiased, and available for everyone? Ironman. I decided that IRONMAN, the 140.6 mile multi-disciplined endurance race was the perfect Venn-diagram from which to reflect my own work ethic, discipline, ability to learn new things, and resource management (finances, time, nutrition, and of course energy) against just about everyone else in life. On Jan 3, 2019 I went on my first run. It was just over 1 mile and it took me about 15 minutes. I was soar for about a week! Safe to say, I wasn’t the fastest or most fit person. I figured that made for a great start for such a test. Do I have what it takes to figure this IRONMAN thing out and how will it reflect my place in the world? <P>
    
    October 15, 2021 I finished the IRONMAN WACO 140.6 mile race in 15 hours and 51 minutes. It wasn’t an easy journey, but I really liked it. I learned a ton! It felt like I got a degree in Physical Science as I studied Potassium X Sodium X H20 management etc… but I really liked it. I learn a ton of new swimming techniques, everything it would take to endure almost 2 hours in the water without stoping to touch the bottom or hold the side of the pool (the race took place in a river) etc… but I really liked it. While I was training I tried to read dozens of books about Triathalon, racing, running,  etc… but I really liked it. From 1 mile in 15m to 140.6 miles in 15 hours… How did I create so much change? I began to leverage this IRONMAN accomplishment against all of my the beliefs I held for my self as a tactic to achieve things I otherwise thought were impossible. <P>
    
    In 2021, I read 100 books (I used to be scared of books), learned how to trade stock options (I used to thing the stock market was for the elite class only), and reached new heights in just about every other area in my life (I went from being singular in focusing on music to interdependence among health, wealth, and family). As I began to uncover new questions on my path I found software engineering. Literally… the idea of coding / programing / working in tech was always something I have been fascinated with. I was just on a different path. Now, I am a software engineer. I learn new languages, I study multi-disciplines, I try to deeply understand intricate logistics and implementation. And, in doing so, I see the world in a whole new light. There are algorithms everywhere, and they are plastic! Coding, like IRONMAN, has awarded the ability to transform my identity. Today, I am a software engineer. Today, I run.code. <P>
